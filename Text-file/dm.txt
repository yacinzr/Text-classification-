In this blog, we will study what is Data Mining. Also, will study data mining scope, foundation, data mining techniques and terminologies in Data Mining. As we study this, will learn data mining architecture with a diagram. Further, will study knowledge discovery. Along with we will also learn data mining applications and pros and cons.
Data Mining is a set of method that applies to large and complex databases. This is to eliminate the randomness and discover the hidden pattern. As these data mining methods are almost always computationally intensive. We use data mining tools, methodologies, and theories for revealing patterns in data. There are too many driving forces present. And, this is the reason why data mining has become such an important area of study.In 1960s statisticians used the terms “Data Fishing” or “Data Dredging”. That was to refer what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data. The term “Data Mining” appeared around 1990 in the database community.
