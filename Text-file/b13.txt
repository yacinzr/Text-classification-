Descriptions:
Capacitors belong to the family of
passive components and are used
in all areas of electronics. They allow
to store a load
electrical at the terminals of two electrodes separated by a
insulator called dielectric .
Their electrical performance depends on the nature of the
dielectric and structure
electrode-insulator-electrode. They are classified into three
large families:
ceramic capacitors;
electrochemical capacitors;
plastic film capacitors.
