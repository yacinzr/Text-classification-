The electrical engineer trained at Polytechnique has a
good knowledge of energy, technologies
electronics, information technology and
physical science. Through training geared towards
many design projects, he knows how to apply a
approach focused on problem solving and
profitability, in accordance with the principles of development
sustainable. He is also aware of the implications
social, economic and ecological achievements
and works in concert with all the actors involved.

The Polytechnique engineer is very well prepared for a
wide range of jobs both in the industrial and
manufacturer than in service companies and
consulting engineering. The development of electrical engineering has been
dazzling in the last fifty years and
Quebec's expertise in this field is recognized
globally.

APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER OF QUEBEC ENGINEERS ARE SPECIALIZED
IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.
It is hard to imagine society without electricity, the engine
central to technological progress for many
years. What then would happen to the lighting of
cities, metro transport, computer and
Internet exchanges, wireless communication and
satellite, pacemakers and
medical instrumentation?

In this context of innovation, the electrical engineer is
a designer who plans and manages projects
complex technologies in such diverse fields
as cellular telephony, navigation systems
aerial and biomedical instruments, the
manufacturing, electronics and its applications
multiple, automatic checks.
