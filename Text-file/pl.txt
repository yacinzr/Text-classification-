As an analytical chemist, you'll use a range of methods to investigate the chemical composition of substances. Your aim will be to identify and understand the substance and how it behaves in different conditions.

The exact role can vary depending on the setting. In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, you would be involved throughout the drug development process. This would include studying the physical or chemical properties of drug substances and formulations, with a view to determining the quality and stability of drug products.
What to expect
Working in multidisciplinary teams is common, as is communicating with scientists and customers from both within and outside the company.
At the start of your career, it's likely you'll be predominantly lab-based but as you reach more senior levels you'll work more in an office.
Jobs are widely available throughout the country and tend to be in large, localised centres. Research and development (R&D) work can be more commonly found in south England.
You may find the work occasionally stressful due to tight deadlines and pressure to solve problems as quickly as possible. Routine analysis can involve doing the same job for long periods of time, although this is less likely at more senior levels.
Typically, travel within a working day and absence from home overnight aren't that common. Overseas travel is rare, although secondments abroad may be possible as you reach higher grades.
Practical experience of working in a laboratory environment is desirable and it can be particularly helpful if your course includes a year in industry. As well as providing you with practical skills, carrying out work experience can also allow you to build good contacts for potential jobs once you graduate.

If you have little or no experience in this area you should still apply for jobs, as full training is often available and employers will know you've picked up essential knowledge from your degree.
