he first step Tesla takes is feeding their neural networks with all the small details and all the possible tasks they can imagine. Since it is done separately — they have many interconnected networks solving minor puzzles all at once. What are the road signs, road markings, cyclists, traffic lights etc.? Everything you can come into while driving and everything the driver can ever think of — Highway Code, destination, maps, perspective, weather conditions etc.
Tesla car makes decisions based on all the small details it has learned. Depending on the situation it synthesizes the decision by combining all the relevant knowledge of particular settings. Changing the decision means running through all the details and information once again.
Main words characterizing the method are — “all the details at once”. For comparison imagine that you do not know how a house looks like. But you are familiar with the looks of a window, roof, walls and sill. When asked to imagine how a house looks — you would be able to do that — better or worse. This is exactly how Tesla’s AI works and how a baby’s brain work — baby does not know what mom or dog is; but he is able to compare distinctive small details and features of mom versus dog good enough to distinguish one from the other.
