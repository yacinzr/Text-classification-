The coil
 Self-inductive effect:
When a current flows through a conductor, it is responsible for creating a
magnetic induction fields. If the current is variable over time, the field
induction will also be and then the phenomenon of self-induction intervenes: this field
variable feeds back on the current which creates it, by slowing down the variation of this current. This
effect corresponds to energy storage in the auto circuit
magnetic.
