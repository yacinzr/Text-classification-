3.6 Basic and Extended Needs
Power supply systems from renewable sources in off-grid operation should be robust, inexpensive and reliable. Most importantly, they need to have a modular structure so they can be extended later. Photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems in off-grid operation supply power to small consumers (3â€“30 kW) far from the public utility grid. An essential component of a modular supply system is a battery inverter, such as the Sunny Island, with a nominal power of 3.3 kW each.

The advanced Sunny Island battery inverter is the grid master and the central component of a modular supply system and enables small-scale island utilities in remote areas. An island grid is easy to plan and install and allows a very flexible operation.

The device includes an intelligent control, which is able to supply different consumers and feed power from different generators. Such generators are, for example, PV string inverters for grid supply, small wind energy plants or diesel units, making the battery inverter useful on nysource. The system management handles battery control, enables limited load management and provides communication interfaces for optional system management units. The required operating modes and parallel switching of current converters can be realized. A battery inverter and a lead acid battery can establish a simple single-phase island grid.
