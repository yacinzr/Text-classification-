Chemical Drugâ€“Excipient-Interaction
In physical interactions, it has been discussed that there will not be any chemical interactions, and it finally could be beneficial as well as detrimental to the final product. Contrarily, chemical interactions are always found to produce a detrimental effect on the product where a separate product is formed following a chemical reaction between the reactants. Effervescent reactions between organic acids (e.g., citric acid) and sodium bicarbonate in the presence of aqueous environment form carbon dioxide (CO2), where this CO2 helps in the disintegration of the solid dosage form for oral consumption of the integrated medicinal component. However, precautions should be taken on storage (impermeable to moisture) and during the preparative process (RH<20), to avoid contact with aqueous medium of the product. Therefore, monitoring of such interactions is highly necessary to provide a high-quality product to the patients. Monitoring could be performed following International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines that include the recommended limits of impurities and its quantification in marketed medicinal products (ICH Tripartite Guideline Impurities in New Drug Products Q3B(R2), 2006). Therefore, the ICH Q3BR guideline includes identification of impurities in new drug products and the motivation of the guideline is the quantification of the degradation products with the reaction pathway and preventive pathway of such reactions.

Chemical interactions for the pharmaceutical ingredients are mostly divided into the following sections:
