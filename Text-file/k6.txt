Data science has experienced a tremendous growth in recent years. The potential to create value out of data has attracted businesses which, as a result, has driven new investments in this field.
The popularity and potential of data science along with the increasing demand for data scientists cause lots of people to make a career change to work in this field.
The biggest challenge for aspiring data scientists is to take the first step into the field. I think what makes it hard to take the first step are the following reasons:
Data science is an interdisciplinary field so it is difficult to obtain and evaluate the required skills.
Data science is still evolving so it is not well established in the traditional education system yet.
There is not a straightforward way to demonstrate your skills if you do not have prior job experience.
In this article, I will elaborate on the third reason and provide my suggestion.
If you follow Medium publications on data science, you must have seen articles that list data science projects to put in your resume or portfolio.
They all are good for practicing hard skills such as coding, data wrangling, data science libraries and frameworks, machine learning algorithms and so on. However, they lack an important skill.
