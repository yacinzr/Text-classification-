New power-supply systems for a wide range of vehicle platforms and a variety of electrical features are facing many requirements. 
Among them are CO2 reduction, transient load response capability and redundancy. These requirements are amendments to the traditional 
power-supply system requirements (such as voltage quality, for example). To fulfil those requirements several potential 12-V power-supply
 topologies are taken into account. A second energy storage device is the classification for these solutions. The technology for the second 
energy storage device can be considered within the entire landscape of batteries or capacitors. The battery based solutions will contain one of several lithium-ion chemistry or NiMH storage devices in addition 
to the leadâ€“acid battery. An alternative to an advanced battery is a capacitor technology for energy storage. The benefit of this technology is high-power capability but it offers only small additional energy content. To integrate a second energy storage device into the power-supply system, the storage technology has to be chosen wisely based on the specific requirements of the vehicle application.
