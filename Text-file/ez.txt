18 Inspection and testing of electric power systems
Electric power systems important to safety shall be designed to permit appropriate periodic inspection and testing of 
important areas and features, such as wiring, insulation, connections, and switchboards, to assess the continuity of the systems 
and the condition of their components . The systems shall be designed with a capability to test periodically (1) 
the operability and functional performance of the components of the systems, such as onsite power sources, relays, 
switches, and buses, and (2) the operability of the systems as a whole and, under conditions as close to design as practical, 
the full operation sequence that brings the systems into operation, including operation of applicable portions of the protection 
system, and the transfer of power among systems.
