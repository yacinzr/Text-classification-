As previously stated, the determination of optical purity is a critical issue in several fields. Although a variety of techniques of assaying exact enantiomeric composition have been developed, so far high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation of enantiomers on crown ether-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) is probably the most efficient, accurate, and convenient means for the direct resolution of underivatized chiral amino compounds <2003JSS242>. Early CSPs, obtained by dynamically coating chiral crown ethers (e.g., 35c) on octadecyl silica gel, showed serious drawbacks associated with the leaching of the selector when using mobile phases with an elevated CH3OH content <1992JCH(625)101>. Conversely, robust CSPs resulted from the covalent bonding of the selector to a solid support, such as aminopropylsilanized silica gel. The most popular CSPs are those derived from crown ether 41 <1998JCH(805)85, 2003JCH(984)163, 2005MIJ213> and chiral pseudo-18-crown-6 ethers <2005JCH(1078)35, 2005CH142>. Some of these are shown in Figure 9. These CSPs are able efficiently to separate most of the tested analytes, which encompass amino acids, amino acid methyl esters, amino alcohols, and lipophilic amines.
