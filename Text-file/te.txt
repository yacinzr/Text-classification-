Chiral Recognition and Separations
Chiral recognition is a chemical interaction, frequently occurring in living systems, by which a given chiral molecule (receptor/host) recognizes a particular stereoisomer (substrate/guest). Studies aimed at mimicking such phenomena have led to a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing molecular recognition. This process takes place via noncovalent hostâ€“guest interactions that typically involve van der Waals, electrostatic, or hydrogen-bonding attractions tempered by steric repulsions. The elucidation of the chiral recognition event has important consequences in a wide range of disciplines, including analytical and separation sciences, biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. Nowadays, a rigorous assessment of the enantiomeric purity of chiral natural or synthetic products is a recommended step for their utilization in medicine, the food industry, and agriculture .
