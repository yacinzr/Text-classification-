Areas of intervention
Electrical engineers
work in several fields including aeronautics,
biomedical, energy, IT, systems
 electrical and electronic, as well as
telecommunications. They contribute to the design
industrial, project management and implementation.
They use mathematics, notions
computer skills, as well as their ability to understand
technological concepts to achieve their ends.

Achievements
The work of electrical engineers is related to
different areas of technology. They design
the material intelligence used to manufacture various
objects, such as MP3 players or stimulators
cardiac. Electric energy is of course at the heart of
their achievements as well as electronics,
microprocessors, chips and miniaturization of
objects.
